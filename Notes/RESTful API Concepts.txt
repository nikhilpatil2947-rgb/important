- REST is a achitecture style to use crate an API.
- RESTFul means which follows the REST principle.
- RESTFul is a way to exchange data between client and server via http methods like (get,post,put,delete).

REST has main principle
1.statelessness
- server does not need the state or session of client(Server ko client ki koi state (ya session) yaad nahi rakhni chahiye.)
- each and every req is independent.
🔹 Example:
Har request ke header mein token ya user info bhejna.

2.Client-server architecture 
- client and server are clearly seperated.
- client only send the data and server only return the data
🔹 Example:
Angular/React app → API call → .NET Core backend → Database.

3.Uniform Interface
- APIs must has to create in consistent way like same format,naming convention.
🔹 Example:
/api/products (list), /api/products/1 (single item).

4.Standard http method
- GET (Retrieve a resource or fetch data)
- POST (create a new record)
- PUT (Update an existing records completely)
- PATCH (Update an existing record partially)
- DELETE (DELETE records)
