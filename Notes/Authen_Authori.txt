🔐 Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It answers the question: "Who are you?"

When a user logs into an application, they typically provide credentials—like a username and password, or a token. The system checks these credentials against a trusted source (like a database or identity provider) to confirm that the user is who they claim to be.

In C#, especially in ASP.NET Core, authentication is often handled using middleware that validates tokens (like JWT), cookies, or external providers (like Google or Microsoft accounts). Once authenticated, the system creates a security context for the user, which can be used throughout the session.
🛡️ Authorization

Authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to perform a specific action or access a particular resource. It answers the question: "What are you allowed to do?"

Once a user is authenticated, the system checks their roles, claims, or policies to decide if they can access certain endpoints, features, or data. For example, a user might be authenticated but not authorized to view admin reports or modify sensitive records.

In C#, authorization is typically implemented using attributes like [Authorize], role checks, or custom policies. It works hand-in-hand with authentication but comes into play only after the user’s identity has been confirmed.
Summary in Theory

Authentication is about identity—proving who you are. Authorization is about access—deciding what you can do once your identity is known.

Both are essential for application security, but they serve very different purposes. Authentication always comes first; authorization follows.
