The "O" in the SOLID principles stands for the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). It's a foundational concept in object-oriented design, especially in C#, and it helps make your code more maintainable, extensible, and robust.


🧠 What Is the Open/Closed Principle?

Definition:

    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This principle was introduced by Bertrand Meyer and is all about designing software so that you can add new functionality without changing existing code.

🔍 Breaking It Down
✅ Open for Extension

    You should be able to add new behavior to a class or module.

    This is typically done through inheritance, interfaces, or composition.

❌ Closed for Modification

    Once a class is tested and stable, you should not modify its source code.

    Modifying existing code can introduce bugs or break existing functionality.

Why It Matters

Imagine you have a class that calculates discounts. If you keep modifying it every time a new discount type is added, you risk:

    Breaking existing functionality

    Making the code harder to test

    Violating the Single Responsibility Principle

Instead, you should extend the class using inheritance or composition, not modify it directly.
✅ Real-World Example in C#
❌ Violating the Principle

public class Invoice
{
    public double GetDiscount(string customerType)
    {
        if (customerType == "Regular")
            return 0.1;
        else if (customerType == "Premium")
            return 0.2;
        else if (customerType == "Elite")
            return 0.3;
        else
            return 0.0;
    }
}

Problem :

Every time a new customer type is added, you must modify this method.

This breaks the Open/Closed Principle.
