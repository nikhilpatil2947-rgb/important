S — Single Responsibility Principle

“A class should have only one reason to change.” — Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

🔎 Meaning

Every class/module should do only one job.

If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one responsibility can break or affect the other.

Keeping one responsibility per class makes code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

❌ Bad Example (violates SRP)

public class Invoice
{
    public void CalculateTotal() 
    {
        // Business logic
    }

    public void SaveToDatabase() 
    {
        // Data access logic
    }

    public void PrintInvoice() 
    {
        // Printing logic
    }
}

Here:

The Invoice class is responsible for:

Business logic (calculating total)

Persistence (saving to DB)

Presentation (printing)

🚨 It has more than one reason to change:

If calculation rules change → modify class.

If database technology changes → modify class.

If printing format changes → modify class.

This violates SRP.

✅ Good Example (follows SRP)

Split responsibilities into separate classes:

public class Invoice
{
    public void CalculateTotal() 
    {
        // Business logic
    }
}

public class InvoiceRepository
{
    public void Save(Invoice invoice) 
    {
        // Data access logic
    }
}

public class InvoicePrinter
{
    public void Print(Invoice invoice) 
    {
        // Printing logic
    }
}
