🧩 What Is the Interface Segregation Principle?

The Interface Segregation Principle states:

    "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."
In simpler terms, it means that a class should not be required to implement methods it doesn’t need. Instead of having one large, all-encompassing interface, you should split it into smaller, more specific ones.

🛠️ Why It Matters

    Avoids bloated interfaces: Large interfaces often contain methods irrelevant to some classes.

    Improves code clarity: Classes only implement what they actually use.

    Enhances flexibility: Easier to change or extend behavior without affecting unrelated parts.

    Reduces coupling: Classes are less dependent on unnecessary functionality.
