explanation of JWT (JSON Web Token) handling in .NET Core technology, covering the concepts, setup, token generation, validation, and securing APIs step-by-step.


What is JWT?

JWT is a compact, URL-safe token format used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. It is widely used for authentication and authorization in 
web applications and APIs.

-----------------------------------------

Why use JWT in .NET Core?

    Stateless authentication: No need to store session info on the server.
    Scalable: Tokens are self-contained and can be validated without database lookups.
    Secure: Tokens are signed to prevent tampering.
    Cross-platform: Works well with SPAs, mobile apps, and microservices.

----------------------------------------

What is JWT used for?

    Authentication: After a user logs in, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the client. The client stores the token (usually in localStorage or cookies) and sends it with every subsequent request. 
    The server verifies the token to authenticate the user.
    Information Exchange: JWTs can securely transmit information between parties because they can be signed, ensuring the data is trustworthy.

----------------------------------------

Token Validation Flow

When a request hits a protected endpoint:

    The JWT middleware extracts the token from the Authorization header.
    Validates the token signature using the secret key.
    Checks token expiration and other claims.
    If valid, sets the user principal in the request context.
    If invalid or missing, returns 401 Unauthorized.
