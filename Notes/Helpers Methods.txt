WHAT IS HELPER METHODS :

- Helper Methods wo chhoti-chhoti functions hoti hain jo code ke andar common repetitive tasks ko simplify karne ke liye banai jaati hain.
- Ye basically reusable utility methods hoti hain jo aap multiple jagah pe use kar sakte ho.
- c A Helper Method is a reusable function designed to perform a specific task that assists or “helps” the main code logic — making the code cleaner, modular, and more maintainable.
- helper methods are reusable utility fuction which makes our code cleaner and modular.
- In ASP.NET Core, we commonly use HTML Helpers and Tag Helpers to generate UI elements dynamically. We can also create our own custom helper methods for tasks like formatting, 
  logging, or validation.
- Ye mostly static hote hain aur project ke multiple areas me use kiye ja sakte hain — jaise controllers, services, ya views.

-eg :- 

public static string Dateformat(Datetime date, string format = "dd-MM-yyyy")
{
	return date.Tostring(format);
}

var res =  Dateformat(DateTime.Now);

TYPES OF HELPER METHODS

1. html helper methods :

- Html helpers are c# methods that generate a Html string.
- they are Typically accessed through the @Html object in Razor views
- a method to generate html elements dynamically.
- it is also used in mvc 5 
eg
@Html.TextBox(), @Html.CheckBox(), @Html.ActionLink(), @Html.BeginForm() 
@Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.UserName)
@Html.LabelFor(model => model.Password)


2. Tag Helpers (ASP.NET Core):

- This is the new feature was introduced in dot net core  that enables server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in razor files.
- They look and feel like  standard html tag but have special attributes that trigger server-side logic.
eg 
<input asp-for="PropertyName">,<a asp-action="ActionName">
