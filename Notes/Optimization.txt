🧠 Pro Tip: How to Think Like a Coder

When optimizing:

    Ask yourself: Can I avoid unnecessary work?

    Look for patterns: Is the array already sorted? Can I skip comparisons?

    Use flags or conditions: Track changes to decide whether to continue.

    Measure impact: Does it improve best case, average case, or worst case?
